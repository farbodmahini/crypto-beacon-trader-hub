You can filter metrics by category using the badge buttons above the metrics panel.

The Trading Signals tab provides AI-generated recommendations based on technical analysis, market conditions, and historical patterns. Signals include:

- Direction (Buy, Sell, Hold)
- Confidence level (percentage)
- Reasoning behind the recommendation
- Suggested entry and exit points

**Note**: Trading signals are informational and should be combined with your own research and risk management strategy.

## Advanced Features

### Detachable Dashboard

One of the most powerful features of the Live Analytics Dashboard is its ability to "pop out" into a separate window that can be moved to a different screen or positioned anywhere on your desktop.

**To detach the dashboard**:
1. Click the "Maximize" button in the top-right corner of the dashboard
2. The dashboard will open in a floating window
3. Drag the window to your preferred position or monitor

**To restore the dashboard**:
1. Click the "Minimize" button in the detached window
2. The dashboard will return to its original position in the application

### Custom Refresh Intervals

You can control how frequently the dashboard refreshes data:

1. Click the "Refresh" button to manually update all data
2. Open Settings to adjust the automatic refresh interval:
   - Real-time (every 5 seconds)
   - Standard (every 15 seconds)
   - Battery-saving (every 30 seconds)

### Filtering and Customization

The dashboard allows you to customize which metrics you see:

1. Use the category filter badges to focus on specific types of data
2. Click the settings icon to show/hide specific metrics
3. Drag and drop metrics to reorder them based on your preference

## Integration with Trading Features

The Live Analytics Dashboard integrates seamlessly with other platform features:

### AI Trading Bots

When viewing the dashboard from the AI Trading Bots section:
- Bot performance metrics will appear in the dashboard
- Trading signals will be tagged with which bots are following them
- You can enable/disable bots directly from the dashboard

### Portfolio Tracking

The dashboard can display metrics specific to your portfolio:
- Portfolio value correlation with selected asset
- Unrealized P&L impact from price movements
- Exposure analysis to the selected asset

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Multi-Monitor Setup**: Use the detachable dashboard on a secondary monitor to keep analytics visible while trading on your primary screen.

2. **Metric Combinations**: Pay attention to correlated metrics. For example:
   - Rising price with increasing volume suggests strong momentum
   - Rising price with decreasing volume may indicate weakening momentum

3. **Alert Strategy**: Set up a ladder of price alerts above and below current price to be notified of significant movements in either direction.

4. **Refresh Considerations**: While real-time updates provide the most current data, they also consume more bandwidth and battery. Adjust based on your trading style and device capabilities.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Use the market correlation tools to understand how different assets move in relation to each other, which can help with portfolio diversification.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard appears frozen or isn't updating**
   - Click the manual refresh button
