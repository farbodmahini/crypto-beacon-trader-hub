# Security and Privacy Documentation

## Data Security Overview
The Crypto Dashboard application takes data security and privacy seriously. This document outlines our approaches, practices, and recommendations for keeping user data secure.

## User Data Protection

### What Data We Store
1. **User account information**:
   - Email address
   - Hashed and salted passwords
   - Account preferences

2. **Portfolio data**:
   - Transaction history
   - Holdings information
   - Performance metrics

3. **Application data**:
   - Watchlists
   - Alerts and notifications settings
   - Dashboard customization preferences

4. **Usage analytics**:
   - Anonymous usage statistics
   - Performance metrics
   - Error logs

### How Data Is Protected

#### Authentication Security
- **Strong password requirements**:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Regular password expiration (optional)

- **Multi-factor authentication**:
  - Email verification
  - Authenticator app integration
  - SMS verification (where available)

- **Session management**:
  - Secure, HttpOnly cookies
  - Automatic session expiration
  - Device tracking for unusual login detection

#### Data Encryption
- **In transit**: All data transmitted using TLS 1.3
- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive stored data
- **API keys**: Encrypted and accessible only to the account owner

#### Third-Party Integrations
- **Exchange API connections**:
  - Read-only API keys recommended by default
  - No withdrawal permissions unless specifically enabled
  - Periodic API key rotation recommendations

- **Data providers**:
  - Vetted for security compliance
  - Limited to necessary data access
  - Regular security assessment

## Privacy Considerations

### User Privacy Controls
- **Data visibility options**: Control what data is shown on your dashboard
- **Analytics opt-out**: Ability to disable usage tracking
- **Data export**: Download your complete dataset anytime
- **Account deletion**: Permanently remove your account and associated data

### Compliance
- **GDPR compliance**: For European users
- **CCPA compliance**: For California residents
- **Privacy policy**: Clear documentation of data practices

## Best Practices for Users

### Securing Your Account
- Use a unique, strong password
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Never share your credentials
- Check active sessions regularly
- Use a password manager

### API Key Security
- Create read-only API keys when possible
- Never share API keys or store them in unsecured locations
- Revoke unused API keys
- Set IP restrictions when supported by exchanges
- Monitor API usage regularly

### General Security Recommendations
- Keep your browser and operating system updated
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Use a secure and private network connection
- Lock your device when not in use
- Consider using a hardware wallet for large holdings
