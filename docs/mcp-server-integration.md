# MCP Server Integration for AI Trading

## Overview
The MCP (Model Computation Platform) server integration allows you to connect your crypto trading application to powerful AI models running on local or remote servers. This enables advanced trading strategies with minimal latency and maximum customization.

## Features
- Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
- Train and deploy AI models directly from the interface
- Real-time trading signals and execution
- Support for different model architectures (LSTM, Transformer, CNN, Reinforcement Learning)
- Customizable risk parameters and timeframes

## Getting Started

### Setting Up an MCP Server
1. Download and install the MCP server software from our repository
2. Configure the server settings in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "port": 5000,
     "modelPath": "./models",
     "allowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
     "logLevel": "info"
   }
   ```
3. Start the server: `mcp-server start`

### Connecting from the App
1. Navigate to the AI Trading Bots section
2. Select the "MCP Servers" tab
3. Click "Connect" on an existing server or add a new one
4. Once connected, configure your model parameters
5. Train your model on historical data
6. Toggle "Automated Trading" to start executing trades

## API Endpoints

### Model Training
`POST /api/train`
```json
{
  "modelType": "lstm-attention",
  "symbol": "BTC/USD",
  "timeframe": "4h",
  "parameters": {
    "epochs": 100,
    "batchSize": 32,
    "learningRate": 0.001
  }
}
```

### Prediction
`GET /api/predict?symbol=BTC/USD&timeframe=4h`

### Trade Execution
`POST /api/execute`
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTC/USD",
  "side": "buy",
  "amount": 0.1,
  "type": "market"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- MCP servers should be properly secured with authentication
- Use SSL for all connections
- Implement API rate limiting
- Set appropriate trading limits to prevent unexpected losses

## Troubleshooting
If you're experiencing connection issues:
1. Check if the MCP server is running
2. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
3. Ensure the server URL is correctly specified
4. Check server logs for any error messages

For more advanced configurations and deployments, please refer to the MCP Server Documentation.
