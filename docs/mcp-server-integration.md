# MCP Server Integration for AI Trading

## Overview
The Model Computation Platform (MCP) server integration enables your cryptocurrency trading application to connect with powerful AI models running on local or remote servers. This architecture provides numerous advantages including reduced latency, increased privacy, customized model training, and enhanced trading strategy development.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously for distributed workloads
- **AI Model Management**: Train, deploy, and monitor machine learning models directly from the interface
- **Real-time Trading Signals**: Receive immediate trading signals based on model predictions
- **Automated Execution**: Execute trades automatically based on model outputs
- **Multiple Model Architectures**: Support for various model types:
  - LSTM with Attention mechanisms
  - Transformer models
  - CNN-LSTM hybrid networks
  - Reinforcement Learning agents
- **Custom Risk Parameters**: Define risk tolerance and position sizing
- **Historical Backtesting**: Test models against historical data before deployment

## Getting Started

### Setting Up an MCP Server
1. Download and install the MCP server software from our repository
2. Configure the server settings in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "port": 5000,
     "modelPath": "./models",
     "allowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
     "logLevel": "info",
     "maxMemoryUsage": "8g",
     "gpuAcceleration": true
   }
   ```
3. Start the server: `mcp-server start`
4. Verify the server is running by checking the status endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/status`

### Connecting from the Application
1. Navigate to the AI Trading Bots section
2. Select the "MCP Servers" tab
3. Click "Connect" on an existing server or add a new one
4. Once connected, configure your model parameters:
   - Select model architecture
   - Choose trading timeframe
   - Set risk level
   - Configure notification preferences
5. Train your model on historical data
6. Toggle "Automated Trading" to start executing trades

## Security Best Practices
- **Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication for all MCP server connections
- **Encryption**: Use SSL/TLS for all communication between the app and MCP servers
- **Access Control**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with appropriate rate limiting
- **Trading Limits**: Set maximum position sizes and trade frequencies
- **Monitoring**: Log all model predictions and trading activities
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the MCP server software up-to-date

## Troubleshooting
If you're experiencing connection issues:
1. Check if the MCP server is running: `mcp-server status`
2. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings
3. Ensure the server URL is correctly specified in the app
4. Check server logs: `mcp-server logs`
5. Verify the API key or authentication token is valid
6. Ensure the model files exist and are not corrupted

### Common Error Codes
- `401`: Authentication failure
- `403`: Insufficient permissions
- `404`: Model or resource not found
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500`: Internal server error (check server logs)
- `503`: Server overloaded or temporarily unavailable

## Performance Optimization
- Use GPU acceleration for model training and inference when available
- Implement batch prediction for multiple symbols
- Schedule model training during off-peak hours
- Cache frequently accessed prediction results
- Use websockets for real-time updates rather than polling

## Deployment Scenarios
- **Development**: Single local MCP server for testing
- **Production**: Multiple distributed MCP servers for redundancy and load balancing
- **Hybrid**: Mix of local and cloud-based MCP servers for optimal performance
