## 9. Recommendations

### Short-term:
- Implement additional unit tests for critical components
- Set up automated CI/CD pipeline
- Consider implementing server-side rendering for improved SEO

### Long-term:
- Consider breaking up larger files into smaller, more focused components
- Implement a state management solution like Redux for more complex state
- Add E2E tests using Cypress or Playwright
- Consider implementing a monorepo structure as the application grows

## Conclusion

The application is now ready for deployment, with all critical issues resolved. The codebase is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices for React and TypeScript development. All features have been implemented and thoroughly tested to ensure a smooth user experience.
