# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the process for deploying the Crypto Trading Platform to various environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. npm or yarn package manager
3. Access credentials for the deployment environment
4. Environment variables configured

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by the application:

```
# API Keys (required for production)
VITE_API_KEY_COINGECKO=your_coingecko_api_key
VITE_API_KEY_CRYPTOCOMPARE=your_cryptocompare_api_key
VITE_API_KEY_NEWSAPI=your_newsapi_api_key

# Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production|staging|development
```

## Build Process

To create a production build:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized assets in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment Options

### Netlify

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
3. Configure environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy the site

### Vercel

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy the site

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Transfer the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve the application
   - For Apache, use an `.htaccess` file with appropriate rewrite rules
   - For Nginx, configure location blocks to handle client-side routing

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, verify:

1. The application loads correctly
2. API connections are working
3. Real-time data updates are functioning
4. All features work as expected in the production environment

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. Identify the last known stable version
2. Redeploy that version using the same deployment process
3. Verify the rollback resolved the issues
4. Investigate the cause of the issues in the problematic deployment

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor the deployed application using:

1. Browser developer tools for client-side performance
2. API response time monitoring
3. Error tracking tools (e.g., Sentry)
4. User behavior analytics

## Security Considerations

1. Ensure all API keys are properly secured
2. Implement content security policy headers
3. Use HTTPS for all connections
4. Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Continuous Deployment

For automated deployments:

1. Configure CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
2. Set up automated testing before deployment
3. Implement staged deployments (dev → staging → production)
4. Configure notifications for build and deployment status

Follow this guide to ensure smooth and reliable deployments of the Crypto Trading Platform.
