# API Management Features

## Overview

The API Management system provides comprehensive tools for connecting, configuring, and monitoring external API services that power the trading platform. This centralized interface allows users to manage API keys, monitor usage limits, check service status, and configure integration parameters for optimal performance.

## Key Features

### API Key Management

Securely store and manage API keys for various exchange and data providers:

**Security Features:**
- Encrypted storage of API keys and secrets
- Permission-based access control
- Visibility controls for sensitive information
- Key rotation and expiration management

**Supported Exchanges:**
- Binance
- Coinbase
- Kraken
- KuCoin
- FTX
- And many more

### Real-Time Status Monitoring

Monitor the status and health of connected API services:

- Live service status indicators
- Response time monitoring
- Historical uptime tracking
- Automatic detection of service degradation
- Scheduled availability checks

### Rate Limit Management

Intelligent handling of API rate limits to prevent throttling:

- Real-time rate limit usage tracking
- Visual indicators of approaching limits
- Automatic request throttling when nearing limits
- Configurable alerts for high usage
- Per-endpoint usage tracking

### API Usage Metrics

Comprehensive analytics on API usage patterns:

- Daily/weekly/monthly usage statistics
- Request distribution by endpoint
- Cost tracking for paid API services
- Usage forecasting and trend analysis
- Anomaly detection for unusual activity

### Failover Configuration

Configure redundancy and failover options for critical API connections:

- Priority-based provider selection
- Automatic failover on service disruption
- Configurable retry policies
- Cache-based fallback options
- Health check parameters

### Provider Settings

Detailed configuration options for each API provider:

- Base URL configuration
- Authentication method selection
- Custom header management
- Endpoint mapping
- Timeout and retry settings
- Service-specific parameters

## Integration Architecture

The API Management system is designed with a layered architecture:

1. **Provider Layer**: Connections to external services
2. **Abstraction Layer**: Unified interfaces for common operations
3. **Cache Layer**: Performance optimization and redundancy
4. **Application Layer**: Service delivery to platform features

## Performance Optimization

Several strategies are employed to optimize API performance:

- **Smart Caching**: Store frequently accessed data
- **Request Batching**: Combine multiple requests where possible
- **Data Compression**: Minimize network bandwidth usage
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections for efficiency
- **Background Refreshing**: Update cached data proactively

## Monitoring and Alerts

Comprehensive monitoring tools for API health:

- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitor latency trends
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Track failed requests
- **Usage Alerts**: Notifications for approaching limits
- **Availability Notifications**: Alerts for service disruptions
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track API usage costs

## Custom Integration Support

Support for extending the API management system:

- **Custom Provider Configuration**: Add new API providers
- **Endpoint Mapping**: Configure custom endpoint structures
- **Authentication Handlers**: Support for various auth methods
- **Response Transformers**: Format data to internal standards
- **Webhook Support**: Send and receive webhook notifications

## Security Considerations

The API Management system prioritizes security:

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for API operations
- **Audit Logging**: Track all API key usage and changes
- **IP Restrictions**: Optional IP-based access control
- **Request Signing**: Support for cryptographic request signing

## Getting Started with API Management

1. **Add Your First API Key**: Configure access to an exchange or data provider
2. **Monitor Status**: Check the health dashboard for connected services
3. **Configure Rate Limits**: Set appropriate thresholds for notifications
4. **Set Up Failover**: Configure backup providers for critical services
5. **Review Usage Metrics**: Monitor your API consumption patterns

## Best Practices

- Regularly rotate API keys for security
- Use read-only permissions when possible
- Configure appropriate rate limit buffers
- Set up failover providers for critical services
- Monitor usage patterns to optimize performance
