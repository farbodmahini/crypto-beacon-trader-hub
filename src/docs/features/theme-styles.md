# Theme Styles and Customization

## Overview

The application features a comprehensive theme system with multiple style options. Users can customize the look and feel of the platform to match their preferences with various dark-themed styles.

## Theme Options

### Dark (Default)
The default dark theme offers a sleek, modern interface with deep backgrounds and high contrast elements for optimal visibility in low-light environments.

### Light
A brighter alternative that maintains the modern aesthetic but with lighter backgrounds and appropriate contrast adjustments.

## Style Options

Users can further customize their experience by selecting from six different color schemes that can be applied to both dark and light modes:

### Default
The standard color palette that balances functionality with a clean, professional aesthetic.

### Ocean Blue
A cool, calming blue-toned theme that provides a serene trading environment with emphasis on focus and clarity.

### Midnight Purple
Rich purple gradients create a premium, sophisticated look while maintaining excellent readability and reducing eye strain.

### Forest Green
Calming green tones create a balanced, natural aesthetic that's easy on the eyes during long trading sessions.

### Amber Gold
Warm amber gradients provide a distinctive look inspired by precious metals and financial themes.

### Ruby Red
Bold red accents create an energetic, attention-grabbing interface perfect for traders who want high visual impact.

### Slate Gray
Professional slate tones offer a business-oriented aesthetic with subtle depth and understated elegance.

## Customization Options

Theme and style preferences are easily accessible through the theme switcher in the top navigation bar. User preferences are automatically saved between sessions.

### How to Change Themes

1. Click the palette icon in the top navigation bar
2. Select a theme (Dark or Light) from the dropdown menu
3. Choose a color scheme from the available options
4. Changes apply instantly and are saved for future sessions

## Technical Implementation

The theming system is built on a combination of CSS variables and Tailwind CSS utility classes. The implementation includes:

- CSS variables for color, spacing, and other design tokens
- Theme-specific overrides for components
- Dark/light mode sensitivity
- Responsive adaptations for different screen sizes

## Accessibility Considerations

All theme and style combinations maintain WCAG compliance for:
- Color contrast ratios
- Focus visibility
- Text legibility
- Interactive element identification

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: The theme system ensures visual consistency across all components and screens
- **Performance**: Theme changes occur without performance impact or page reloads
- **Maintainability**: Adding new theme variants is straightforward through the centralized theme system
- **Responsiveness**: All themes are fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to different device sizes

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the theming system include:
- Custom theme creation
- Component-specific theme overrides
- Scheduled theme switching (day/night auto-switching)
- Theme export/import functionality
