# AI Integration Guide

This document provides details on how the platform integrates with various AI models and services to enhance trading capabilities, market analysis, and user experience.

## OpenRouter Integration

The platform uses OpenRouter as a unified API gateway to access various AI models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and more.

### Configuration

OpenRouter integration is configured through the settings interface:

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
2. Enter your OpenRouter API key
3. The key is stored securely in the browser's localStorage
4. No API keys are sent to our servers

### Available Models

The platform supports multiple AI models through OpenRouter:

- **GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)** - Advanced models for complex trading strategy development
- **Claude 3 models (Anthropic)** - Good for nuanced market analysis and explanations
- **Gemini Pro (Google)** - Balanced performance for general tasks
- **Llama 3 (Meta)** - Open-source models with strong reasoning capabilities

### AI-Powered Features

#### Trading Strategy Generation

AI models can generate custom trading strategies based on:
- Asset selection
- Timeframe preferences
- Risk tolerance
- Market conditions
- Technical indicators

Example prompt template:
```
Generate a detailed cryptocurrency trading strategy for {asset} with the following parameters:
- Timeframe: {timeframe}
- Risk level: {riskLevel}
{additionalContext}

Please structure your response as follows:
1. Strategy name
2. Strategy description
3. Key indicators to use
4. Entry signals
5. Exit signals
6. Risk management rules
7. Expected performance metrics
```

#### Market Analysis

AI models provide comprehensive market analysis:
- Overall market sentiment assessment
- Individual asset analysis
- Support and resistance levels
- Potential catalysts
- Risk factors

#### Portfolio Optimization

AI can analyze your portfolio and provide:
- Diversification recommendations
- Risk assessment
- Rebalancing suggestions
- Performance projections
- Asset allocation advice

### Cost Considerations

Different models have different pricing structures:
- GPT-4 models: Higher cost, but more sophisticated analysis
- Claude models: Mid-range pricing with strong analytical capabilities
- Llama 3 and similar models: Lower cost, good for routine tasks

The platform tracks token usage and provides estimates of costs when using these features.

## Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

The AI integration uses a service-based architecture:

1. **openRouterService.ts** - Core service for OpenRouter API interactions
2. **aiPortfolioService.ts** - Portfolio analysis and optimization
3. **aiTradingService.ts** - Trading strategy generation and evaluation

### Data Flow

The typical data flow for AI features:

1. User configures parameters in the UI
2. Application prepares a structured prompt
3. Request is sent to OpenRouter API
4. Response is parsed and structured
5. Results are displayed to the user

### Error Handling

AI services implement robust error handling:
- API key validation
- Connection error management
- Rate limiting handling
- Fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable

### Code Example

```typescript
// Example of generating a trading strategy
const generateStrategy = async (asset, timeframe, riskLevel) => {
  try {
    const result = await openRouterService.generateTradingStrategy({
      asset,
      timeframe,
      riskLevel
    });
    
    return parseStrategyResponse(result.content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating strategy:", error);
    return getFallbackStrategy(asset);
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

For best results from AI models:
- Be specific in requirements
- Structure prompts with clear sections
- Provide context and constraints
- Use consistent formatting

### Response Processing

When handling AI responses:
- Parse structured sections
- Extract actionable insights
- Validate recommendations against known criteria
- Present information in digestible formats

### User Experience

To enhance the AI experience:
- Show transparent generation process
- Allow refinement of generated content
- Provide explanations of AI recommendations
- Enable saving and comparison of multiple AI outputs

## Future Enhancements

Planned AI feature enhancements:
- Multi-modal inputs (incorporating charts and technical indicators)
- Continuous learning from market outcomes
- Personalized strategy tuning based on user preferences
- Collaborative filtering of strategies across users
