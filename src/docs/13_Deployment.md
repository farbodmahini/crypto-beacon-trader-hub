```

### Cloud Provider

- **Primary**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Secondary/Backup**: Azure

### Key Services

- **Frontend Hosting**: AWS Amplify / Vercel
- **API Hosting**: AWS Lambda / Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas / Supabase
- **CDN**: CloudFlare / AWS CloudFront
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / CircleCI
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch / DataDog

## Deployment Process

### Continuous Integration

1. **Code Push**
   - Developer pushes to feature branch
   - CI system runs automated tests
   - Code quality checks run (linting, type checks)

2. **Pull Request**
   - Developer creates PR to merge to development branch
   - CI builds application and deploys to PR preview environment
   - Automated tests run against the PR build
   - Code review process begins

3. **Merge**
   - After approval, PR is merged to development branch
   - CI builds and deploys to testing environment
   - Integration tests run against testing environment

### Continuous Deployment

For development and testing environments, CD is fully automated:

1. **Build Process**
   - CI system builds the application
   - Optimized production build is created
   - Build artifacts are stored

2. **Automated Deployment**
   - Build artifacts are deployed to the target environment
   - Environment-specific configuration is applied
   - Post-deployment tests verify the deployment

3. **Notification**
   - Team is notified of successful deployment
   - Any deployment issues are reported immediately

### Production Deployment (Semi-Automated)

For production, a manual approval gate is included:

1. **Release Preparation**
   - Release candidate is created from staging
   - Full test suite runs against release candidate
   - Release notes are prepared

2. **Approval Gate**
   - Release manager reviews test results
   - Stakeholder approval is required
   - Deployment schedule is confirmed

3. **Deployment Execution**
   - Pre-deployment backup is created
   - Blue/green deployment process begins
   - Traffic is slowly shifted to new version

4. **Verification**
   - Automated smoke tests run
   - Manual verification checks performed
   - Monitoring for errors and performance issues

5. **Finalization or Rollback**
   - If successful, deployment is finalized
   - If issues found, traffic is redirected to previous version
   - Post-mortem conducted for any rollbacks

## Deployment Technologies

### Frontend Deployment

- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading
- **Asset Management**: Content hashing for cache busting
- **CDN Integration**: Automated asset distribution to CDN

### Configuration Management

- **Strategy**: Environment variables for runtime configuration
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault
- **Feature Flags**: LaunchDarkly / Split.io

### Container Strategy

- **Container Format**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for API services
- **Registry**: Amazon ECR / Docker Hub

## Release Strategy

### Versioning

- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.4.2`)
  - MAJOR: Breaking changes
  - MINOR: New features, backward compatible
  - PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible
- Git tags for each release

### Release Cadence

- **Feature Releases**: Every 2-4 weeks
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for critical fixes
- **Major Releases**: Quarterly

### Hotfix Process

For critical issues in production:

1. Fix is developed against production branch
2. Special testing process is expedited
3. Hotfix deployment follows simplified approval
4. Changes are merged back to development branch
5. Post-mortem is conducted

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

- **Performance**: Load time, Time to Interactive, API response times
- **Errors**: JS exceptions, API errors, 5xx rates
- **User Experience**: Rage clicks, session duration, conversion rates
- **System**: CPU usage, memory consumption, network throughput

### Monitoring Tools

- **Application Performance**: New Relic / DataDog
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **User Analytics**: Google Analytics / Mixpanel

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Database**: Daily full backups, hourly incrementals
- **Static Assets**: Redundant storage across regions
- **Configuration**: Version controlled and backed up
- **Retention Policy**: 30 days for daily backups, 1 year for monthly snapshots

### Disaster Recovery

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Failover Strategy**: Multi-region deployment with automated failover
- **Regular DR Testing**: Quarterly failover exercises

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security

- **Secure CI/CD Pipeline**: Limited access, encrypted secrets
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Pre-deployment security checks
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Image Scanning**: Container vulnerability scanning

### Runtime Security

- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall protection
- **DDOS Protection**: CloudFlare / AWS Shield
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers

## Compliance & Governance

### Deployment Approvals

- Feature deployments require technical approval
- Production deployments require business approval
- Critical systems require security team review

### Audit Trail

- All deployments logged with:
  - Who initiated the deployment
  - What was deployed (commit hash, version)
  - When it was deployed
  - Approval chain documentation

### Compliance Requirements

- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for user data
- CCPA compliance for California users
- SOC 2 compliance for general security

## Post-Deployment Procedures

### Verification Process

1. **Automated Tests**: Smoke tests run on production
2. **Manual Verification**: Critical path testing
3. **Monitoring Period**: Intensive monitoring for 24 hours after deployment
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags used for progressive rollouts

### Rollback Procedures

1. **Decision Criteria**: Predetermined thresholds for rollback
