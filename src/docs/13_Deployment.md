# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document details the deployment process for the Crypto Beacon Trader Hub. It covers deployment environments, infrastructure setup, build processes, and post-deployment procedures to ensure reliable and consistent releases.

## Deployment Environments

### Environment Structure

Our deployment pipeline consists of four environments:

| Environment | Purpose | Access | Update Frequency |
|-------------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Development | Active development, feature testing | Developers only | Continuous |
| Staging | Pre-production testing, QA | Internal team | After feature completion |
| Beta | Early user testing, feature validation | Select users | After staging approval |
| Production | Live application | All users | Scheduled releases |

### Environment Configuration

Each environment uses environment-specific settings defined through:

- Environment variables
- Feature flags
- API endpoints
- Service integrations

## Infrastructure

### Hosting Architecture

The application is deployed using a cloud-native architecture:

```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for automated CI:

- Code linting
- Type checking
- Unit and integration tests
- Build verification
- Bundle size analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm test

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Archive build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          path: dist
```

### Continuous Deployment

Automated deployment is configured for each environment:

- **Development**: Auto-deploy on commit to `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Auto-deploy on PR merge to `staging` branch
- **Beta**: Manual promotion from staging
- **Production**: Manual promotion from beta

## Deployment Steps

### Pre-deployment Checklist

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered after deployment:

1. **Trigger rollback**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:rollback
   ```

2. **Update status page** to notify users

3. **Notify team** via designated communication channels

4. **Investigation**:
   - Collect error reports
   - Review logs
   - Identify root cause

5. **Fix and re-release**:
   - Fix identified issues
   - Follow standard deployment process for new release

## Feature Flags

Feature flags are used to control feature availability across environments:

- Enable/disable features without redeployment
- A/B testing of new functionality
- Gradual feature rollout
- Emergency feature disabling

### Feature Flag Management

We use a custom feature flag system that integrates with our deployment pipeline:

```typescript
// Example feature flag usage
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/use-feature-flag';

function AdvancedTradingPanel() {
  const { isEnabled } = useFeatureFlag('advanced_trading');
  
  if (!isEnabled) {
    return <BasicTradingPanel />;
  }
  
  return <AdvancedPanel />;
}
```

## Database Migrations

### Migration Strategy

Database migrations follow these principles:

- All schema changes are versioned
- Migrations are forward-only (include rollback instructions)
- Zero-downtime migrations
- Backward compatibility with previous application version

### Migration Process

1. **Development**:
   - Create migration files
   - Test locally
   - Review for performance impact

2. **Staging**:
   - Apply migrations
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify application compatibility

3. **Production**:
   - Schedule migration window
   - Apply migrations
   - Verify database state

### Migration Script Example

```sql
-- Migration: 001_create_users_table
BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

COMMIT;
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics

We monitor the following metrics:

- **Performance**:
  - Page load time
  - Time to interactive
  - API response times
  - Resource utilization

- **Errors**:
  - JavaScript exceptions
  - API error rates
  - Failed user interactions
  - Authentication failures

- **Business**:
  - User registrations
  - Active trading sessions
  - Trading volume
  - Conversion rates

### Alert Configuration

Alerts are configured for:

- Error rate exceeding threshold
- API latency above threshold
- Failed deployments
- Security incidents
- Database issues
- Certificate expiration warnings

## Logging Strategy

### Log Levels

| Level | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| ERROR | Exceptions, critical failures |
| WARN | Potential issues, degraded functionality |
| INFO | Normal operations, significant events |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for debugging |
| TRACE | Very detailed debugging information |

### Log Structure

Standardized log format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15T14:22:33.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "frontend",
  "environment": "production",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "userId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "context": {
    "requestId": "req-1234",
    "browser": "Chrome 98",
    "os": "macOS 12.3.1",
    "path": "/login"
  }
}
```

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- **Database**: Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups
- **User Data**: Continuous replication across regions
- **Configuration**: Version-controlled and backed up
- **Code**: Repository with multiple remotes

### Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **Detection**:
   - Automated monitoring triggers alerts
   - Support channels for user reports

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify recovery path

3. **Recovery**:
   - Follow service-specific recovery procedures
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Verify system integrity

4. **Communication**:
   - Update status page
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide regular updates

5. **Post-mortem**:
   - Analyze root cause
   - Document lessons learned
   - Implement preventative measures

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security

- **Secret Management**:
  - Environment variables for sensitive data
  - Secrets rotation schedule
  - Access control for deployment systems

- **Infrastructure Security**:
  - HTTPS everywhere
  - Content Security Policy
  - Regular security scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability monitoring

- **Compliance**:
  - Audit logs for all deployments
  - Separation of duties
  - Approval workflows for production changes

## Performance Optimization

### Pre-deployment Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Break bundle into smaller chunks
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and serve optimized images
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading of non-critical components

### CDN Configuration

- **Cache Strategy**:
  - Long-term caching for versioned assets
  - Short caches for dynamic content
  - Cache invalidation on deployment

- **Edge Functions**:
  - Personalization at the edge
  - Geolocation-based content
  - A/B testing distribution

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

We follow semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible new features
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Tagging

Each release is tagged in the repository:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

## Release Notes

### Release Documentation

For each release we create:

1. **Release Notes**: User-facing features and fixes
