# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Crypto Beacon Trader Hub. The strategy is designed to ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of the application across all of its components and integrations.

## Testing Objectives

Our testing objectives are to:

1. Verify that the application functions correctly according to requirements
2. Identify and resolve defects early in the development lifecycle
3. Ensure the application performs well under expected load
4. Validate the application's security against common threats
5. Confirm compatibility across targeted browsers and devices
6. Maintain test coverage throughout the codebase

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components, functions, or modules in isolation.

**Scope:**
- React components
- Custom hooks
- Utility functions
- Service modules
- State management logic

**Tools:**
- Jest: Testing framework
- React Testing Library: Component testing
- @testing-library/react-hooks: Hook testing

**Approach:**
- Each unit test should focus on a single unit of functionality
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Test both success and error paths
- Aim for high coverage of business logic

**Coverage Target:**
- 80% code coverage for core business logic
- 70% overall code coverage

**Example:**

```typescript
// Button component test
test('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn();
  render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click me'));
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});

// Utility function test
test('formats currency correctly', () => {
  expect(formatCurrency(1234.56, 'USD')).toBe('$1,234.56');
  expect(formatCurrency(1234.56, 'EUR')).toBe('â‚¬1,234.56');
});
```

### Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly.

**Scope:**
- Component interactions
- Context providers with dependent components
- API service integration
- State management across component boundaries

**Tools:**
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

**Approach:**
- Test workflows that span multiple components
- Verify context providers correctly provide state to consumers
- Use mock API responses to test service integration
- Focus on data flow between components

**Coverage Target:**
- Test all critical user workflows
- Cover main integration points between components and services

**Example:**

```typescript
// Testing a component that relies on a context provider
test('portfolio summary shows correct balance from context', () => {
  const wrapper = ({ children }) => (
    <PortfolioProvider initialValue={mockPortfolio}>
      {children}
    </PortfolioProvider>
  );
  
  render(<PortfolioSummary />, { wrapper });
  expect(screen.getByText('$12,345.67')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Testing API integration
test('loads and displays trade history', async () => {
  // Mock API response
  server.use(
    rest.get('/api/trades', (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ trades: mockTrades }));
    })
  );
  
  render(<TradeHistory />);
  
  // Check loading state
  expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  // Check loaded state
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Trade History')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  // Verify trades are displayed
  expect(screen.getAllByRole('row')).toHaveLength(mockTrades.length + 1); // +1 for header
});
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests verify the application works correctly from a user's perspective.

**Scope:**
- Complete user workflows
- Authentication flows
- Trading and portfolio management
- Settings and configurations

**Tools:**
- Cypress: E2E testing framework
- Playwright: Cross-browser testing

**Approach:**
- Create tests that mimic real user behavior
- Test critical paths from start to finish
- Verify UI elements respond correctly to user inputs
- Include tests for different user roles and permissions

**Coverage Target:**
- Cover all critical user flows
- Test on all supported browsers
- Include responsive testing for mobile views

**Example:**

```typescript
// Cypress test for login and navigation
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  it('allows a user to log in and navigate to dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('test@example.com');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    
    // Verify successful login
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    cy.contains('Welcome, Test User').should('be.visible');
    
    // Check navigation
    cy.get('nav').contains('Portfolio').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/portfolio');
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate the application's speed, responsiveness, and stability under various conditions.

**Scope:**
- Page load times
- Component rendering performance
- Data fetching and processing efficiency
- Interaction responsiveness

**Tools:**
- Lighthouse: Web performance testing
- React Profiler: Component rendering analysis
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Custom performance metrics tracking

**Approach:**
- Measure time-to-interactive for critical pages
- Profile rendering performance for data-intensive components
- Test with varying data loads
- Identify and optimize bottlenecks

**Performance Targets:**
- First contentful paint < 1.8s
- Time to interactive < 3.5s
- Smooth scrolling and interactions (60fps)
- Memory usage within reasonable limits

**Example Performance Monitoring:**

```typescript
// Performance measurement hook
const usePerformanceMonitoring = (componentName: string) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    return () => {
      const endTime = performance.now();
      const renderTime = endTime - startTime;
      
      // Log or send to analytics
      console.log(`${componentName} render time: ${renderTime.toFixed(2)}ms`);
      
      // Could send to analytics service
      analyticsService.trackPerformance(componentName, renderTime);
    };
  }, [componentName]);
};
```

### Visual Regression Testing

Visual regression tests detect unintended changes to the UI appearance.

**Scope:**
- Component appearance
- Page layouts
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Theme variations

**Tools:**
- Storybook: Component isolation and visualization
- Chromatic: Visual regression testing with Storybook
- Percy: Visual testing and review

**Approach:**
- Create baselines for component appearance
- Automatically compare screenshots after changes
- Test across different viewport sizes
- Test with different themes (light/dark)

**Coverage Target:**
- Cover all key UI components and pages
- Test at major responsive breakpoints
- Test with all theme variants

### Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.

**Scope:**
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- ARIA attributes and roles

**Tools:**
- Axe: Automated accessibility testing
- WAVE: Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
- Manual testing with screen readers

**Approach:**
- Run automated accessibility checks
- Perform manual testing with keyboard-only navigation
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Verify sufficient color contrast

**Conformance Target:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
