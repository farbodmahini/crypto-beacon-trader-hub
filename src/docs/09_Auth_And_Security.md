# Authentication & Security

This document outlines the authentication system and security measures implemented in the Crypto Trading Platform.

## Authentication System

### Overview

The platform uses Supabase Authentication for user identity management, providing a secure, flexible, and scalable authentication system. This includes:

- Email/password authentication
- Social login providers (optional)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session management
- JWT-based authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration Flow**
   - User enters email and password
   - Password strength is validated client-side
   - Request is sent to Supabase Auth API
   - User record is created in `auth.users` table
   - Trigger creates associated record in `public.profiles` table
   - Confirmation email is sent if email verification is enabled
   - User is directed to complete profile setup

2. **Login Flow**
   - User enters email and password
   - Credentials are sent to Supabase Auth API
   - Upon successful authentication, JWT is returned
   - JWT is stored securely in browser storage
   - Session is established and user is redirected to dashboard

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT contains user identity and permissions
   - Token includes expiration time
   - Automatic refresh token mechanism maintains session
   - Session listener updates UI based on auth state changes
   - Clear session handling for authentication errors

4. **Logout Flow**
   - User initiates logout
   - Client calls Supabase auth.signOut()
   - JWT and refresh tokens are invalidated
   - Local session storage is cleared
   - User is redirected to login page

### Multi-factor Authentication

For enhanced security, the platform supports multi-factor authentication:

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for authenticator apps
- Backup recovery codes for account access
- Setup wizard with QR code for easy configuration
- Enforcement options for high-security operations

## Authorization Model

The platform implements a robust authorization model to control access to resources:

### Role-Based Access Control

- **User Roles**:
  - Regular Users: Standard platform access
  - Premium Users: Access to advanced features
  - Administrators: System management capabilities

- **Permission Framework**:
  - Feature-level permissions
  - Data access permissions
  - Administrative permissions

### Row-Level Security

Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for trading_bots table
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own bots"
ON trading_bots
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

- All database tables have appropriate RLS policies
- Policies enforce read/write permissions
- System-level data has separate access controls
- Shared resources have specific visibility policies

### API Authorization

- All API endpoints verify authentication
- JWT validation for authenticated requests
- Role-based endpoint access controls
- Rate limiting based on user role and endpoint

## Security Measures

### Data Encryption

- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- API keys and secrets stored with encryption
- Database column encryption for sensitive fields
- Secure transmission over HTTPS

### Password Security

- Bcrypt password hashing with appropriate work factor
- Password strength requirements:
  - Minimum length of 10 characters
  - Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
  - Common password detection
- Secure password reset mechanism
- Brute force protection with login attempt limits

### API Key Management

- Secure storage of third-party API keys
- Encrypted storage in database
- Access control for key usage
- Automatic key rotation support
- Key permission scoping

### Session Security

- Short-lived JWT tokens (15 minutes)
- Secure storage of refresh tokens
- Secure cookie settings:
  - HttpOnly flag
  - Secure flag
  - SameSite strict policy
- CSRF protection
- Session invalidation on suspicious activity

### Security Headers

The application implements security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

## Vulnerability Protection

### XSS Prevention

- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- CSP implementation
- Use of safe framework features
- Regular security testing

### CSRF Protection

- Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- SameSite cookie policy
- Verification of request origins
- CORS configuration

### Injection Attack Prevention

- Parameterized queries
- ORM usage for database operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database connections

### Third-Party Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Software composition analysis
- Automated security alerts

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Auditing

- Comprehensive security event logging
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Critical data access events
- Administrative actions
- Suspicious activity detection

### Incident Response

- Defined security incident response plan
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- User notification system for account security events
- Account recovery procedures

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR compliance for user data
- Data minimization principles
- User data export capabilities
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Privacy by design approach

## Security Testing

- Regular security testing:
  - Static application security testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
  - Penetration testing
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Dependency checking

## User Security Features

- Account security dashboard
- Login history and active sessions
- Session revocation capability
- Security notifications
- Two-factor authentication management
- API key management interface

This comprehensive security approach ensures that user data remains protected, access is properly controlled, and the platform maintains a strong security posture against potential threats.
