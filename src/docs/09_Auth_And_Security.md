# Authentication & Security

## Overview

Crypto Beacon Trader Hub implements a comprehensive security architecture to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of trading operations. This document outlines the authentication mechanisms, security controls, and best practices implemented throughout the platform.

## Authentication System

### Authentication Methods

The platform supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different security needs:

1. **Email and Password**
   - Standard authentication with strong password requirements
   - Password policy enforcement (minimum length, complexity)
   - Brute force protection with rate limiting
   - Secure password storage using bcrypt with appropriate work factors

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps
   - SMS-based verification codes (with SIM-swap protection advisories)
   - Email verification codes for account recovery
   - Hardware security key support (WebAuthn/FIDO2)

3. **OAuth Integration**
   - Support for major OAuth providers (Google, Apple, GitHub)
   - Secure token handling and validation
   - Limited permission scopes for OAuth integrations
